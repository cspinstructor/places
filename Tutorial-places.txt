Goto:  https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/get-api-key
and click on the blue button GET A KEY

Create folder places.
npm init
npm install axios --save
npm install express --save
npm install mongodb --save

Create a file: .gitignore and put this line:
  node_modules

Create new repository in Github called: places, followed by:
  git init
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial Commit"
  git remote add origin https://github.com/paulchin/places.git
  git push -u origin master

Create file:  app.js and add the lines: const axios... const port
Create views/partials folders

Copy bootstrap jumbostron from w3c bootstrap into home.hbs in views folder.
Copy navbar from w3c bootstrap into partials/navbar.hbs
Inject navbar into home.hbs.

Create a form.hbs and update the navbar link to include a Search.

Create a result.hbs and insert the relevant server.post('/getplaces') handler in app.js

In app.js, first make the call to google-geocode to get the lat,lng, then use that to make
the call to google-places by chaining the promises together and display the json result:
  res.status(200).send(response.data.results);

Next, modify result.hbs to show a table. Refer to:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35382964/accessing-nested-array-with-handlebars-from-json-and-loop-through/35383293
on how to access objects within json.  Use {{photos.[0].photo_reference}}

Modify app.js to include hbs helper for the result.hbs

Debugging (no need)
````````
enter debugger; line in app.js
in cmd, run:  node --inspect-brk app.js
open chrome://inspect  and open dedicated dev tools for node

Add new function in app.js to extract the name and photo_reference.

------------- REACTJS --------------
Installed mongoose for server, tried postman then found with robo3t that it created placesapp inside Admin collections. Watched Setting Up Mongoose udemy for Node.js course stopped there.
